I am a Ph.D. student at École de technologie supérieure in Montreal, Canada, conducting research at [LIVIA](https://liviamtl.ca) under the supervision of Prof. [Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io) and Prof. [Ismail Ben Ayed](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/ibenayed/).
My research focuses on computer vision, particularly on low-supervision techniques and the utilization of pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP. During my Ph.D., I have addressed challenges in generalized few-shot semantic segmentation, few-shot adaptation of vision-language models for classification, and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

I hold a master's degree in artificial intelligence from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. During my master's, I worked on feature disentanglement in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), under the supervision of Prof. [Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah](https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/).
 My academic journey began at the same institution, where I completed my bachelor’s degree.

In addition to my academic background, I have practical experience as a software engineer at [Divar](https://divar.ir/s/tehran), a leading classified ads website in Iran.
