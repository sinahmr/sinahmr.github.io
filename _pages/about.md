I am a Ph.D. student at École de technologie supérieure in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, conducting research at LIVIA under the supervision of Professors [Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io) and [Ismail Ben Ayed](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/ibenayed/). 

[//]: # ( learning efficiently in low data regime for computer vision and multi-modal problems)

I am currently working as a visiting researcher at ServiceNow, where I research **web agents**.
Prior to that, I worked on enhancing the **pre-training of ViT-based approaches on large-scale datasets**. I also focused on low-supervision techniques in computer vision and the application of pre-trained vision-language and foundation models. During my Ph.D., I addressed challenges in **open-vocabulary semantic segmentation**, **few-shot adaptation of vision-language models for classification**, and **generalized few-shot semantic segmentation**.

I hold a master's degree in artificial intelligence from Sharif University of Technology. During my master's program, I worked on **feature disentanglement in variational autoencoders (VAEs)**, under the supervision of Professor [Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah](https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/).
My academic journey began at the same institution, where I completed my bachelor's degree.

In addition to my academic background, I have practical experience as a software engineer at [Divar](https://divar.ir/s/tehran), a prominent classified ads website in my home country.
