I am a Ph.D. student at École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada. I am a researcher at LIVIA, supervised by Prof. [Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io) and Prof. [Ismail Ben Ayed](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/ibenayed/).
I am broadly interested in computer vision with low supervision. I have recently tackled the problem of generalized few-shot semantic segmentation, and I am currently tackling open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

[//]: # (, in which the model recognizes new classes given their names.)

I have a master's degree in artificial intelligence from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. I worked on feature disentanglement in VAEs, under the supervision of Prof. [Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah](https://sharif.edu/~soleymani/).
I obtained my bachelor's from Sharif University of Technology as well. 

I also have the experience of working as a software engineer at [Divar](https://divar.ir), which is a classified ads website operating in Iran.
